      "Indische Buurt (\"Indies Neighborhood\") is a neighbourhood in the eastern portion of the city of Amsterdam, in the Dutch province of Noord-Holland. The name dates from the early 20th century and is derived from the fact that the neighbourhood's streets are named after islands and other geographical concepts in the former Dutch colony of the Dutch East Indies. The first street was named in 1902. In 2003, there were around 23,357 inhabitants. The neighbourhood is bounded on the west by the railroad Amsterdam - Hilversum (with the Muiderpoort Station), on the east side by Flevopark, on the north side by Zeeburgerdijk and on the south side by the Ringvaart Watergraafsmeer. Indische Buurt is the oldest part of the Zeeburg district and is very ethnically diverse, and a high percentage of the population is of immigrant origin (for Zeeburg this is already high at 55%, but higher in the Indische Buurt) and there are an estimated 100 languages spoken.\n",
